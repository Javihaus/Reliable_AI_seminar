# Session 12: Risk Documentation and Production Deployment

## Regulatory Compliance and Stakeholder Communication

**Date:** Thursday, February 19, 2026 | 10:00 AM - 11:30 AM PST

---

## Overview

This final session covers documenting architectural limitations, failure modes, and hybrid solutions for regulatory review and organizational decision-making. Students produce deployment-ready documentation packages.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you will be able to:
1. Document capability classifications for stakeholders
2. Quantify failure modes with appropriate metrics
3. Prepare regulatory-compliant documentation
4. Design production monitoring protocols

## Materials

## Key Concepts

### Documentation Components

A complete deployment documentation package includes:

1. **Capability Classification Matrix**
   - Tasks the system handles
   - Reliability ratings per task
   - Hybrid architecture justification

2. **Failure Mode Quantification**
   - Brittleness measurements
   - False positive/negative rates
   - Scaling analysis results

3. **Risk Assessment**
   - Risk severity ratings
   - Mitigation strategies
   - Residual risk acceptance

4. **Production Monitoring Plan**
   - Metrics to track
   - Alert thresholds
   - Escalation procedures

### EU AI Act Compliance

Key requirements (August 2026 deadline):
- Transparency about AI use
- Risk assessment documentation
- Human oversight mechanisms
- Technical documentation

### Stakeholder Communication

Different audiences need different information:
- **Technical teams:** Full methodology and results
- **Management:** Summary with business impact
- **Regulators:** Compliance-focused documentation
- **Users:** Clear capability statements

## Pre-Session Preparation

1. Compile all testing results from the course
2. Review EU AI Act requirements for your use case
3. Identify key stakeholders for your deployment

## Practical Exercise

During the session, you will:
1. Complete your capability classification matrix
2. Summarize failure mode findings
3. Draft risk assessment
4. Outline monitoring plan

## Deliverable

**Due:** Sunday, February 22, 2026

Submit a **Production Deployment Documentation Package** including:
- Executive summary (1 page)
- Capability classification matrix
- Failure mode quantification report
- Hybrid architecture specification (if applicable)
- Risk assessment with mitigations
- Production monitoring plan
- Regulatory compliance checklist

## Final Project

**Due:** Friday, February 28, 2026

Complete risk characterization for your production deployment incorporating all course learnings.

## Course Completion

Congratulations on completing Production LLM Deployment! You now have:
- A systematic methodology for assessing LLM capabilities
- Tools for detecting failure modes before deployment
- Hybrid architecture design skills
- Regulatory-compliant documentation templates

Apply these skills to deploy LLMs responsibly and safely.
