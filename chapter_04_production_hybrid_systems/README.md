# Chapter 4: Production-Ready Hybrid Systems

This chapter teaches students to build production-grade agentic systems that combine LLM intelligence with deterministic reliability, regulatory compliance, and continuous improvement.

## Contents

- **content.md**: Complete theory content (8 sections, ~60 min)
- **examples/**: Live demonstration notebooks
  - `example_01_hybrid_architecture.ipynb`: Building a hybrid LLM+deterministic system
  - `example_02_validation_rubrics.ipynb`: Co-evolving validation frameworks
  - `example_03_compliance_framework.ipynb`: EU AI Act compliance implementation
- **homework/**: Assignment materials
  - `homework_assignment.md`: Instructions and requirements
  - `homework_notebook.ipynb`: Student template
  - `homework_solution.ipynb`: Reference solution

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, students will be able to:

1. Design hybrid architectures that use LLMs only where necessary
2. Implement validation rubrics that improve over time
3. Build EU AI Act compliant systems (Articles 13, 15, 72)
4. Create continuous improvement pipelines
5. Deploy production-ready agentic systems with confidence
6. Integrate all techniques from Chapters 1-3 into cohesive architecture

## Prerequisites

- Complete Chapters 1, 2, and 3 including homework
- Have implemented at least one crystallized workflow
- Understand observability and cost tracking
- Familiarity with production deployment concepts

## Time Allocation

- **Theory**: 35 minutes
- **Live Examples**: 25 minutes
- **Homework**: 6-8 hours

## Key Concepts

- **Hybrid Architecture**: LLM intelligence + deterministic reliability
- **Validation Rubrics**: Co-evolving quality frameworks
- **EU AI Act Compliance**: Transparency, logging, human oversight
- **Continuous Improvement**: Automated learning from production data
- **Production Readiness**: Monitoring, rollback, incident response

## Expected Results

- Production-grade systems combining all course techniques
- 70-85% cost reduction from baseline
- EU AI Act compliance for high-risk AI systems
- Automated quality improvement over time
- Robust incident detection and response

## Course Culmination

This chapter brings together all prior learning:
- **Chapter 1**: Diagnose and prevent failures
- **Chapter 2**: Observe and measure system behavior
- **Chapter 3**: Crystallize patterns for cost efficiency
- **Chapter 4**: Deploy production-ready hybrid systems

## Next Steps

After completing this chapter, students will have:
- A complete production-ready agentic system
- Compliance documentation for EU AI Act
- Monitoring and improvement infrastructure
- Skills to build, deploy, and maintain AI agent systems at scale
